Client and server perform noise XX handshake
client writes their auth info as 1024 bytes, encrypted with aes256gcm. The first 512 bytes are the username, the last 512 bytes are the password.
If the client is authenticated, continue, else the server writes an error to the stream, encrypted, and closes the stream.

If authenticated the client will write their instructions followed by any associated data. 
The instructions are 256 bytes and are encrypted.

The server reads the INSTRUCTION_SIZE bytes from the stream
    server decrypts the instructions
    server parses the instructions
        if the client is authorized to give these instructions, the server proceeds to instructions step
        if the client is not authorized, write proper error code, encrypted, not compressed, to the client. The server closes the stream

INSTRUCTIONS:
    4. Query(Associated data: Query),
    6. NewUser(Associated data: user_string),
    11. MetaListTables,
    12. MetaListKeyValues,

    
    1. Query(Associated data: Query)
        Server reads the query data, compressed and encrypted, from the stream.
            If the query is valid, the server writes the query response, compressed and encrypted to the stream.
            If the query is invalid, the server writes the proper error code, compressed and encrypted, to the stream.
        Server closes the stream
    2. NewUser(Associated data: user_string)
        Server reads the user_string, compressed and encrypted, from the stream.
            If the user_string is valid, the server writes "OK", encrypted but not compressed.
            If the user_string is invalid, the server writes the proper error code, compressed and encrypted, to the stream.
        Server closes the stream
    3. MetaListTables
        Server writes the list of tables, encrypted and compressed, to the stream.
        Server closes the stream.
    4. MetaListKeyValues
        Server writes the list of key value pairs, encrypted and compressed, to the stream.
        Server closes the stream.

# EZDB

A small database for small bespoke apps. Meant to be fast, easy to use with .csv files, and lightweight to host.
Absolutely minimal dependencies.
Future features, in order, are planned as:
 - Uploading and querying csv tables, strictly or casually (schema or schemaless)
 - Encrypted connections
 - GUI interface
 - Scaling solutions for larger datasets and more queries

This is not meant to be a replacement for Postgres or other SQL monsters, just a easy little database for co-ordinating
data in a small application.
